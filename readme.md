# Conway's game of life

I always thought this was a cool looking algorithm to play around with. I'm sure
there's plenty of ways to make this in python. For my implementation, I used numpy
arrays to store the map state, and matplotlib to animate the game over a set number
of generations.

## What I'd like to do with this

- [ ] Add more patterns
- [ ] make a form of grid customizer to manually draw a map to run
- [ ] Refactor and document each function and try to optimize as much as I can.
- [ ] Make the grid run indefinitely instead of pre-render a set # of generations.
- [ ] Take command line arguments to customize grid size, patterns, etc.
- [x] Add type hinting and docstrings to functions
